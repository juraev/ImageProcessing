# ImageProcessing
This program is written on Qt and includes tools for transfering images of any kind and size to grayscale and/or white black images. There is also possiblity to compute Hu's moments(7 moment invariants of scaling, rotation and transformation).

Soon, I will enable possiblity of choosing grayscale coefficients manually.
Before this, I will add several options to "To W/B" menu to choose method for getting white black image.
